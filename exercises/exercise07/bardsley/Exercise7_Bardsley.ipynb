Don't shoot for the moon. This exercise is intended to give you a chance to practice finding and analyzing spatial data, not to address the world's greatest challenges.\n","- Consider using this exercise to get a head start on your final project or explore options for it. Your project doesn't need to focus on spatial analysis for it to play a role. Are there datasets you might join together based on spatial locations?\n","- Don't go overboard. If you're hitting a wall with coding, write pseudocode and turn that in. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the done. But if you're energized and having fun by chasing down a thorny solution to a coding problem, by all means feel free to keep at it!\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"08e433dd-dd67-49da-9249-b53a2296e7c8","metadata":{"id":"08e433dd-dd67-49da-9249-b53a2296e7c8"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-QHOcIVYKUb9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712581715408,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":27247,"user":{"displayName":"Jesse Michael Bardsley","userId":"06352888650268413688"}},"outputId":"949b4bca-3eaf-400c-f647-f1b67dd15e1d"},"id":"-QHOcIVYKUb9","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","import geopandas as gpd\n","import numpy as np"],"metadata":{"id":"Z_Opisv6KW5T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712582694797,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":205,"user":{"displayName":"Jesse Michael Bardsley","userId":"06352888650268413688"}}},"id":"Z_Opisv6KW5T","execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Exercise07_Bardsley')"],"metadata":{"id":"TDCMREys4ORJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712582698911,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":211,"user":{"displayName":"Jesse Michael Bardsley","userId":"06352888650268413688"}}},"id":"TDCMREys4ORJ","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#This is a test of a distance decay function that I can eventually use\n","#on my final project.
