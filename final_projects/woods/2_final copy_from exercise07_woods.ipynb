Don't shoot for the moon. This exercise is intended to give you a chance to practice finding and analyzing spatial data, not to address the world's greatest challenges.\n","- Consider using this exercise to get a head start on your final project or explore options for it. Your project doesn't need to focus on spatial analysis for it to play a role. Are there datasets you might join together based on spatial locations?\n","- Don't go overboard. If you're hitting a wall with coding, write pseudocode and turn that in. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the done. But if you're energized and having fun by chasing down a thorny solution to a coding problem, by all means feel free to keep at it!\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"08e433dd-dd67-49da-9249-b53a2296e7c8","metadata":{"id":"08e433dd-dd67-49da-9249-b53a2296e7c8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715177877664,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":271,"user":{"displayName":"Kayla Joy Woods","userId":"14429950323281518497"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Where are schools in Delaware that are underenrolled\n","# link to save for future: Delaware Public School Funding Gap - Overview https://www.arcgis.com › home › item\n","# anothre one: https://education.delaware.gov/community/data/reports/nps/"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import os"],"metadata":{"id":"L5K0lSgfU53_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715177878589,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":678,"user":{"displayName":"Kayla Joy Woods","userId":"14429950323281518497"}}},"id":"L5K0lSgfU53_","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"toAPK0bEW0CR","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715177900416,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":21836,"user":{"displayName":"Kayla Joy Woods","userId":"14429950323281518497"}},"outputId":"04f7437b-8bd9-4d5c-87af-9c7990d9d3a8"},"id":"toAPK0bEW0CR","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks//woods_07/')\n","\n","privateschools = pd.read_csv('listofprivateschoolsinDE.edit.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"bJCPpYe-W-LU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715177901098,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":687,"user":{"displayName":"Kayla Joy Woods","userId":"14429950323281518497"}}},"id":"bJCPpYe-W-LU","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["privateschools"],"metadata":{"id":"_4TtUv_5V7ci","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":964},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1715177901098,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Kayla Joy Woods","userId":"14429950323281518497"}},"outputId":"87455298-d99e-49bc-9f72-432863970090"},"id":"_4TtUv_5V7ci","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   PSS_SCHOOL_ID                               PSS_INST  LoGrade  HiGrade  \\\n","0         249817                ALBERT EINSTEIN ACADEMY        3       10   \n","1       A0101559                     APPLE GROVE SCHOOL        6       13   \n","2       A9700826                        AQUINAS ACADEMY        2       17   \n","3       BB200329  ASTRA ZENECA CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER        2        3   \n","4       BB200330                 AUGUSTINE HILLS SCHOOL        9       16   \n","..           ...                                    ...      ...      ...   \n","72      A2100767                  URBAN PROMISE ACADEMY       12       16   \n","73      A0900734                   URBAN PROMISE SCHOOL        2       11   \n","74        249646                URSULINE ACADEMY, LOWER        3       10   \n","75        249748                     WEST CENTER SCHOOL        6       13   \n","76        250174                          WILEYS SCHOOL        6       13   \n","\n","                                    PSS_ADDRESS    PSS_CITY  PSS_COUNTY_NO  \\\n","0      101 GARDEN OF EDEN RD 104 WILMINGTON, DE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","1          2391 HAZLETTVILLE RD DOVER, DELAWARE       DOVER          10001   \n","2               2370 RED LION RD BEAR, DELAWARE        BEAR          10003   \n","3         1920 ROCKLAND RD WILMINGTON, DELAWARE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","4          6 STONE HILL RD WILMINGTON, DELAWARE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","..                                          ...         ...            ...   \n","72        2223 N MARKET ST WILMINGTON, DELAWARE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","73       2401 THATCHER ST WILMINGTON , DELAWARE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","74  1106 PENNSYLVANIA AVE WILMINGTON , DELAWARE  WILMINGTON          10003   \n","75               1418 YODER DR HARTLY, DELAWARE      HARTLY          10001   \n","76            21 SHARON HILL RD DOVER, DELAWARE       DOVER          10001   \n","\n","    PSS_COUNTY_FIPS PSS_STABB  PSS_FIPS  ...
